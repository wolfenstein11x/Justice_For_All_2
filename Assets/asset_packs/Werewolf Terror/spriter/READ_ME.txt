Spriter project included if you want to create your custom animations with Brashmonkey Spriter and export it as sprite sheets.

Not recommended to import the project within your game with any Unity's Spriter plugins/extensions (Spriter2Unity or something else) as there are some issues that cause the imported animation messed up.
